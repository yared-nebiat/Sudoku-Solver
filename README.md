# Python Sudoku Solver
This repository contains a Python implementation of a sudoku solver. The solver takes a sudoku grid as input and returns a solution if one exists.

## Requirements
Python 3.x

## Input format
The input is a 9x9 matrix representing the sudoku grid, where 0 represents an empty cell.

Example:

grid = [

    [7, 8, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0],
    [6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0, 0, 9],
    [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 1, 0, 7, 8],
    [0, 0, 7, 0, 4, 0, 2, 6, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0, 9, 3, 0],
    [9, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 5],
    [0, 7, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2],
    [1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 0, 0],
    [0, 4, 9, 2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7]
]

## Output
The output is a 9x9 board representing the solution of the sudoku grid if one exists.
